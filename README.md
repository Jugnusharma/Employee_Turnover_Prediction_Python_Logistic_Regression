# Turnover_Prediction_Python_Logistic_Regression
How to predict the turnover possibility of employees in a company

**Executive Summary:**
To express the relationship between non-linearly related dependent and independent variables, we use nonlinear regression analysis. Here, I will introduce one of the most popular nonlinear regression techniques: Logistic Regression, using Python. Logistic regression examines the relationship between dependent variables, which can only take one of a set of values, and independent variables, using probability theory. The response variable in logistic regression is always binary (e.g., 1 or 0), but the independent or predictor variables can be continuous or categorical.

**Business Case:**
Predicting employee turnover is crucial because it helps companies save on the costs associated with recruiting and training new employees, maintain productivity by retaining experienced staff, and improve employee morale. It aids in strategic workforce planning and enhances employee engagement by addressing issues leading to turnover. Additionally, companies that successfully retain top talent gain a competitive advantage through a stable and knowledgeable workforce, ultimately contributing to overall business success. By predicting employee turnover, organizations can implement targeted strategies to retain employees, improve workplace culture, and enhance overall organizational performance.


**Skills:**
SQL: CTEs, Joins, Case, aggregate functions
Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Writing functions, building a product funnel, statistics
Tableau: ETL, calculated columns, data visualization, data modeling


**Methodology:**
	1. SQL query that extracts, cleans, and transforms the data from the database.
	2. Conduct a more detailed Logistic regression in Python to
		○ explore the data
		○ pre-process the data
		○ train the model and evaluate the model
		○ predict with using test data
	3. Build a dashboard in Tableau
